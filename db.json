    "description": "I've worked with Flutter since its release back in 2017, with prior experiences with native Android development (7+ years) and React Native (4+ years) on many mobile projects from small to medium-size, using many frameworks and 3rd-party libraries. I have enough experience and can work hard to achieve it."
